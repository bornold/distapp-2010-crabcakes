    <h1>MERCURY</h1>

    The 1954 Mercury Sun Valley received ample publicity,
    claiming " A freshness of view, a new gaiety and glamour, vast new areas of visibility,
    a whole new concept of light and luxury. You're comfortably 'out of doors'
    all year long with that wonderful feeling of being fashionably first."
    Actually, much of this happy puffery rang true, with certain qualifications.
