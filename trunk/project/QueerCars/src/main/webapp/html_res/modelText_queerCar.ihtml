    <h1>QUEER CAR</h1>
</p>
<p>
    I decided to buy a Jeep Wrangler but was afraid that it was a Queer Car.
    I asked my friends who all worked as mechanics and parts guys if it was a Queer Car.
    They all said: "no way, Wrangler is cool". So I buy the Wrangler and they all say:
    "Hey Bob, when you gonna put the rainbow flag sticker on it".
