        Cadillac is currently the second oldest American automobile manufacturer behind Buick
        and among the oldest automobile brands in the world. Depending on how one chooses to measure,
        Cadillac is arguably older than Buick; however, upon the demise of Oldsmobile,
        Buick is generally accepted to currently be the oldest American make still in production.
